1. The bug is that the numbers are not actually adding. They are just being added together as a string rather than as a number.
2. I would fix this by changing the num1 and num2 because the reason that adding the two numbers becomes a string is that the num1 and num2 are string themselves. So to fix that, I used parseInt() on the document.getElementById().value since that gives the answer in a num instead of a string. Then when the numbers are added, it will numerically add the two numbers together.
